# **PL94171**: Tabulate P.L. 94-171 Redistricting Data Summary Files

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:
experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
[![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/CoryMcCartan/PL94171/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/CoryMcCartan/PL94171/actions)

<!-- badges: end -->

The **PL94171** package contains tools to process legacy format summary
redistricting data files produced by the United States Census Bureau pursuant to
P.L. 94-171. These files are generally available earlier but are difficult to
work with as-is.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/PL94171")
```

## Basic Usage

Just need block-level data for total and voting-age population by race? Then
`pl_tidy_shp()` is all you need.

``` r
# put the path to the PL 94-171 files here, or use `pl_url()` to download them
pl_path = system.file("extdata/ri2018_2020Style.pl", package="PL94171")
pl_tidy_shp("RI", pl_path)
```

To tabulate at different geographies, or to extract other variables, check out
the [Getting Started page](articles/PL94171.html).
