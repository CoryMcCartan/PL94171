The **PL94171** package contains tools to process legacy format summary
redistricting data files produced by the United States Census Bureau pursuant to
P.L. 94-171. These files are generally available earlier but are difficult to
work with as-is.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CoryMcCartan/PL94171")
```
